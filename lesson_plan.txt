Lesson Plan

Code for Community at The Ohio State University (Abbreviated C4C)
Team 2, "World's Best-est Team"
Presenting: Introduction to Basic Programming Concepts with JavaScript
Demonstration Program: "The World's Hardest Game"
Based on: "The World's Hardest Game" by Stephen Critoph

Expected Lesson Time: 40 Minutes

Expected Number of C4C Instructors: 4

Students per C4C Instructor (Optimal): 4 - 6 students

Goals: 
- Familiarize students with source code at a basic level
- Students should have a basic understanding of what a variable is and at least one way in which it can be used
- Students should have a basic understanding of if-statements and, by extension, the basic function of a control-structure. 

Required Resources: 
- One Desktop or Laptop computer per student (Macs and PCs are both acceptable, tablets of any type are NOT, smartphones are also insufficient)
- Web browser on each computer
- Internet Access

Recommended Resources: 
- Projector
- Dry-Erase Board or Chalkboard

Plan: 
- Introduction (~5 Minutes total):
    - C4C instructors will introduce themselves by name
    - Students will be directed to the game and source code website
        - This will be done with the link go.osu.edu/worldshardestgame
    - Students will be directed how to launch the game
- Exploration time (~10 Minutes total): 
    - (~5 Minutes) Students will be instructed to play the game and attempt to complete the first level
        - The first level will demonstrate the mechanics of the game
        - This level will be easy to complete using the game controls
        - Upon completing the first level, students will proceed to the second level
    - (~5 Minutes) Students will attempt to complete the second level
        - The second level will be extremely difficult to complete using the game controls
        - This is by design; the idea is that students will have to 'cheat,' that is; modify the source code, to make the level easier
- Explanation of basic coding concepts (~10 Minutes total): 
    - C4C instructors will introduce the concept of a variable (using a dry-erase board or chalkboard)
    - C4C instructors will demonstrate how changing the value of a variable affects the functionality of an example program (using the projector)
    - C4C instructors will point out a spot in the code in which a variable is used
        - Preliminarily, the idea is to point out an integer variable that controls the speed at which the obstacles move
        - The implication is that the students will be able to slow down the motion of the obstacles to make the game easier    
    - C4C Instructors will introduce the concept of an if-statement
    - C4C instructors will demonstrate how an if-statement controls if instructions are executed in a program
    - C4C instructors will point out a spot in the game source code in which an if statement is used
        - Preliminarily, the idea is to nest the collision-detection code inside an if-statement
        - The implication is that the students can modify a boolean variable to stop the collision-detection code from running
            - This will in-turn allow the player to phase through the obstacle to win
- Application of Concepts (~15 Minutes):
    - Students will be 'let loose' to modify the source code
    - Students will be expected to apply the concepts demonstrated in the C4C lecture
    - The goal is for students to use these techniques to make the second level easy enough to complete
    - C4C instructors will walk among the students and help them out whenever possible.
